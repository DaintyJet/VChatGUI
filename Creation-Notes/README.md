# Notes on Creation and Management
This folder contains notes used, and made when creating the VChat GUI program.

There are two avenues of developing the VChat GUI program. The first is creating the GUI application as a C++ program with [WinRT/Win GUI API 2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/cpp-and-winrt-apis/intro-to-using-cpp-with-winrt), and using C# (C-Sharp) as a Universal Windows Application

3) We may need to use a WPF application for access to system resources as UWP is sandboxed.
